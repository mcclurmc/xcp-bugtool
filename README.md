XCP Bugtool
===========

NOTE: This is a work in progress. This is the bugtool program from XCP. We are
working on porting this to Debian for use with the XCP toolstack, but for now
it will be used internally by the XenServer test framework. 

To do:
------
- Replace bugtoolTarfile.py with standard tarfile.py
- Translate XCP directory paths to Debian paths
- Add proper Debian package file info
